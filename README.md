# Crowdfunding-ETL

The  crowdfunding ETL project just received a new dataset that contains information about the backers who’ve pledged to the live projects. And, an Independent Funding wants an ETL process on this dataset and a data analysis by using SQL queries. Specifically:
- Extract and transform the backers’ contact information from a CSV file to create a DataFrame that will be exported as a CSV file.
- Then, do the load phase. Using the dataset to create an ERD and a table schema for creating a new table in the crowdfunding_db database.
- And, upload the CSV file that contains the backers’ information into this table.
- Finally, you’ll perform a data analysis on the crowdfunding_db database by using SQL queries.
